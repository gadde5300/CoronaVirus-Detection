# CoronaVirus-Detection
Detecting corona virus using X-ray images.
## Abstract
Currently, the detection of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) is one of the main challenges in the world, given the
rapid spread of the disease. Recent statistics indicate that the
number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 is increasing
exponentially, with more than 1.6 million confirmed cases; the
disease is spreading to many countries across the world. In this
study,I analse the incidence of COVID-19 distribution across
the world. Ipresent an artificial-intelligence technique based
on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect COVID19 patients using real-world datasets. Our system examines chest
X-ray images to identify such patients. Our findings indicate that
such an analysis is valuable in COVID-19 diagnosis as X-rays are
conveniently available quickly and at low costs. 
## IntroductionI. Introduction
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global pandemic
that was discovered by a Chinese physician in Wuhan, the
capital city of Hubei province in mainland China, in
December 2019 [1]. Currently, there is no approved human
vaccine for combating it. COVID-19 propagation is faster
when people are in close proximity. Thus, travel restrictions
control the spread of the disease, and frequent hand washing
is always recommended to prevent potential viral infections.
Meanwhile, fever and cough are the most common infection
symptoms. Other symptoms may occur, including chest
discomfort, sputum development, and a sore throat. COVID19 may progress to viral pneumonia which has a 5.8%
mortality risk. The death rate of COVID-19 is equivalent to 5%
of the death rate of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.
The total number of people infected with COVID-19
worldwide is 5,790,103 as of May 27, 2020 whereas the
numbers of reported deaths and recoveries are 357,432 and
2,497,618 respectively. Most of the cases were recorded in the
USA, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, mainland China, UK,
and Iran [2]. Saudi Arabia, with 78,541 cases, has the highest
number of reported cases among all the Arab countries.
Meanwhile, the number of reported cases in Jordan is 720,
whereas the numbers of deaths and recoveries are 9 and 586
respectively. The number of reported cases in Australia is
7150, whereas the numbers of deaths and recoveries are 103
and 6579, respectively. Since February 2020, information
technology services, such as mobile apps, have been used to
curb the potential risk of infection in mainland China. The
mobile apps suggest users to self-quarantine and alert the
concerned health authorities when someone infected by the
virus. They also monitor infected people, and the last persons
that they had contact with .
Since it was first reported, the disease has spread
exponentially across the world and has become an
international concern. A research conducted by Jiang et al. 
revealed that the death rate of COVID-19 is 4.5% across the
world. The death rate of patients in the age range of 70â€“79
years is 8.0%, whereas that of patients above 80 years is 
14.8%.
